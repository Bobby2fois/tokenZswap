# TokenZswap Known Limitations & Future Improvements

## Smart Contract Limitations

### TokenSwap AMM Limitations

1. **No Fee Mechanism**
   - **Issue**: While the AMM implements a 0.3% trading fees, fees simply accumulate in the pool.
   - **Impact**: Liquidity providers can't claim their portion of fees without removing all their liquidity.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement a fee distribution system that allows LP providers to claim their portion of fees only.

2. **Limited Price Oracle**
   - **Issue**: No external price oracle integration for accurate token pricing.
   - **Impact**: The AMM relies solely on internal reserves for price calculation, making it vulnerable to manipulation.
   - **Future Improvement**: Integrate with Chainlink or other oracle solutions for more accurate and manipulation-resistant pricing.

3. **Impermanent Loss**
   - **Issue**: Liquidity providers are subject to impermanent loss with no mitigation strategies.
   - **Impact**: LPs may lose value compared to simply holding tokens when prices diverge significantly.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement concentrated liquidity positions (similar to Uniswap v3) or impermanent loss insurance.

4. **Single Pool Type**
   - **Issue**: Only supports a single pool with fixed 50/50 weighting.
   - **Impact**: Cannot optimize for different token pairs or risk profiles.
   - **Future Improvement**: Support multiple pool types with different weightings and parameters.

### NFT Marketplace Limitations

1. **No Batch Approval**
   - **Issue**: NFT batch listing still requires individual approvals due to ERC721 standard limitations.
   - **Impact**: Users must approve each NFT individually before batch listing, increasing gas costs and transaction count.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement support for ERC721 contracts that have batch approval capabilities.

2. **Fixed Price Listings**
   - **Issue**: NFT prices are fixed in token amounts rather than USD value.
   - **Impact**: As token values fluctuate, NFT prices may become unintentionally expensive or cheap.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement price feeds to adjust prices based on token value fluctuations.

3. **No Royalties**
   - **Issue**: No support for creator royalties on secondary sales.
   - **Impact**: Original creators don't receive compensation for secondary market activity.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement EIP-2981 royalty standard support.

4. **Limited Auction Support**
   - **Issue**: Only fixed-price listings are supported, no auctions or offers.
   - **Impact**: Reduces market efficiency and price discovery mechanisms.
   - **Future Improvement**: Add support for English auctions, Dutch auctions, and offer systems.

5. **No Collection Verification**
   - **Issue**: No mechanism to verify authentic NFT collections.
   - **Impact**: Users may be exposed to counterfeit or copycat NFTs.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement a collection verification system.

## Security Considerations

1. **No Formal Audit**
   - **Issue**: No formal security audit has been conducted on the smart contracts.
   - **Impact**: Potential vulnerabilities may exist that could lead to loss of funds.
   - **Future Improvement**: Conduct a comprehensive security audit with a reputable firm.

2. **Front-Running Vulnerability**
   - **Issue**: No protection against front-running attacks in the AMM.
   - **Impact**: Malicious actors can extract value by front-running user transactions.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement commit-reveal schemes or other front-running protection mechanisms.

3. **Limited Access Controls**
   - **Issue**: Basic access controls with no time-locks or multi-signature requirements.
   - **Impact**: Single point of failure for contract administration.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement timelocks, multi-signature requirements, and more granular access controls.

4. **No Emergency Pause**
   - **Issue**: No mechanism to pause contract functionality in case of emergency.
   - **Impact**: Cannot quickly respond to discovered vulnerabilities.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement pausable contracts with appropriate governance controls.
